# emotion-aware-eca
This repository show the code for the paper "Learning Emotion-Aware Contextual Representations for Emotion Cause Analysis" \
To train the emotion model run train_emotion.py, checkpoints will be stored in checkpoint_emotion \
To create predicted emotions, run predict_emotion.py, for lexicon-enhanced results, run predict_emo_lexicon.py \
To train and evaluate the cause extraction based on qa/untyped/typed_markers run train_qa.py/train_untyped_marker.py/train_typed_marker.py\
As we are clearing up our code, we will add environment requirements and provide better code for easier training. \
